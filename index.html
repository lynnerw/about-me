  <h2>I'm An Adventurous Spirit...</h2>
  <p><span class="drop-character">B</span>arely contained within a meditative soul, preparing for the next exciting phase of this life journey, with my eyes on the stars and my boots on the ground.</p>
  <p>Two of the things I can't live without:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The peaceful quiet and extravagant beauty of nature.</li>
    <li>The grand and glorious sound of music.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where's Home?</h2>
  <p><span class="drop-character">I</span> grew up in several towns in upstate New York, then moved to North Carolina, then to Virginia, then back to North Carolina, down to Georgia, back up to North Carolina, and now reside in Virginia. In between I also lived in Colorado and Germany for one to two years each. So home...<strong>home is wherever I'm hanging my car keys for months at a time.</strong></p>

  <h2>More About Me</h2>
  <h3>Favorite Way to Spend a Sunday Morning</h3>
  <p><span class="drop-character">w</span>henever possible, I lay to take my time getting out of bed, listen to some old Big Band music, Billie Holiday, Herb Albert... and sip my coffee on the back patio while the rising sun shines through the trees.</p>
  <h3>Favorite Music</h3>
  <p><span class="drop-character">I</span> really can't choose one type of music or one song over another; it depends on my mood. When I exercise, it might be hip-hop, electronica, or rock; when I drive in traffic, classical or pop or folk; and when I'm making Sunday brunch, it's swing music from the 30's and 40's.</p>
  <h3>Dream Job</h3>
  <p><span class="drop-character">M</span>y dream job would be any situation that would allow me to work from home most of the time. I'd really enjoy working on web projects that entail making improvements and enhancements, for example, re-doing an older website to be responsive and WCAG2.0 accessible. I'm also thinking it will be really fun to learn about service workers and how to build  progressive web apps so I can fold those into my job possibilities.</p>
  <p>Eventually I can imagine working on my own, supporting small businesses and non-profits: gathering the requirements, doing the design, development, content, and web analytics report templates, empowering them to do their minor content updates and helping them set up the best social media outreach for their model.</p>
  <p>Ideally, it would be a long-term business relationship, where I continue to check in on how the site is performing, do and report on A/B testing, and tweak the site to better meet their business goals.</p>
